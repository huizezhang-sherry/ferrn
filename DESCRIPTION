Description: Diagnostic plots for optimisation, with a focus on projection pursuit. These show paths the optimiser 
takes in the high-dimensional space in multiple ways: by reducing the dimension using principal component analysis, and
also using the tour to show the path on the high-dimensional space. Several botanical colour palettes are included, reflecting the 
name of the package.
