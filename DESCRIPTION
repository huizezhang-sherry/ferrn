Description: Diagnostic plots for optimisation, with a focus on projection pursuit. These show paths the optimiser 
    takes in the high-dimensional space in multiple ways: by reducing the dimension using principal component analysis, and
    also using the tour to show the path on the high-dimensional space. Several botanical colour palettes are included, reflecting the 
    name of the package. A paper describing the methodology can be found at <https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2021/RJ-2021-105/index.html>.
